## Motherboard
The Motherboard is one of the most important parts of a PC because it connects all of the other hardware. It acts like a nervous system.
  All components are attatched to the circut board. Some psysically attatched to the board with no intend to remove them such as the underlying circuitry, the CPU socket, RAM, Expansion slots, and a variety of other chips.
Other devices such as hard drives and ower supplies are attatched with their own connectors.

### Form Factors
Micro ATX and ITX are specifically designed to be paired with low-wattage power supplies to reduce the ammount of heat produced by the computer. Because these two are smaller they also offer fewer options for adding expansion cards vs the ATX design.
