## Motherboard
The Motherboard is one of the most important parts of a PC because it connects all of the other hardware. It acts like a nervous system.
  All components are attatched to the circut board. Some psysically attatched to the board with no intend to remove them such as the underlying circuitry, the CPU socket, RAM, Expansion slots, and a variety of other chips.
Other devices such as hard drives and ower supplies are attatched with their own connectors.

### Main features of a Motherboard
- Form factors
- Chipsets
- Processor Sockets
- Memory Slots
- Expansion Slots
- Disk Controllers
- Power Connectors
- BIOS/Firmware
- CMOS and CMOS battery
- Back-panel connectors
- Front-panel connectors

 > *ATX Stands for Advanced Technology Extended*

### Form Factors
Micro ATX and ITX are specifically designed to be paired with low-wattage power supplies to reduce the ammount of heat produced by the computer. Because these two are smaller they also offer fewer options for adding expansion cards vs the ATX design.

## Chipset
A chipset is a collection of chips or circuts that perform interface and peripheral functions for the processor.
  Said differently, this collection of chips provide interfaces for memory, expansion cards, and on-board peripherals.
It generally dictates how how the mothernoard will communicate with the installed peripherals.

### Northbridge and Southbridge
> *Chipsets can usualy be divided into two major groups Northbridge and Southbridge*

***Northbridge***

The Northbridge subset of a motherboards chipset performs one important function: management of high-speed peripherals communications. The Northbridge is a response primarily for communications with integrated  video and processor-to-memory communications.

***Southbridge***

The Southbridge subset of chipset is responsible for providing support to the onboard slower peripherals (PS/2, parallel ports, serial ports, Serial and Parallel ATA, and so on).
Managing their communications with the rest of the computer and the resources given to them.
  If you are thinking about any  component other than the CPU, memory and cache, or intergrated video, the Southbridge is in charge.

  The communications between the CPU and memory occur over what is known as the *front side bus* (FSB), which is just a set of signal pathways connecting to the CPU and main memory. The *back side bus*
  (BSB),if present is a set of signal pathways between the CPU and any external cache memory.
